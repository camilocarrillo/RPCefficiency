RPCefficiency
=============

My RPC efficiency code. 

This commit is able to run the first step (without RE4). 
Files not needed have been cleanded. 
The second step shows a segmentation fault once htmltemplates is included.
Compiling and running in 900

TODO: 
* Add RE4 for the efficiency. 
* Do Karol timing histograms
